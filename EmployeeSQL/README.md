# Introduction

In this project, we are researching about people whom a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

## Resources

6 csv files :

Departments.csv

dept_emp.csv

dept_manager.csv

employees.csv

salaries.csv

titles.csv

## Outline

### Data Modeling

Created and ERD using QuickDB

### Data Engineering

1) create a database

2) created a schema using sql queries

3) created tables

4) Imported data into tables from csv files

### Data Analysis

Using data stored in database, the following research questions where answered using sql queries:

1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4) List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

The tables generated were downloaded and saved in the Output_analysis folder
